  <p>Hi!</p><br>
  
  <p>I'm Lauren. I'm just an amateur baker from San Diego, California that happens to bake and blog on the weekends.</p><br>
  
  <p>This blog is new summer hobby that started near the end of middle school. I would sit in my classes, pretending to take notes on Shakespeare, when I was actually browsing through food blogs and coming up with ideas on how to start my own. Before the beginning of the next school year, I finally decided to create this blog to document any new recipes or recipe modifications I developed.</p><br>
  
  <p>I hope you guys have as much fun trying out these recipes as I did making them!<img src="http://res.freestockphotos.biz/pictures/14/14956-illustration-of-a-cherry-pv.png" class=about_img></p>
